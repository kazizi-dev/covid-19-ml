# **Project Details:**
Taking a data mining approach to understand a COVID-19 dataset, and obtain valuable insights out of it through data analysis and visualizations.

## **Problem:**
The number of infected cases continue to rise everyday. Find a way to predict if patients will be hospitalized, deceased or recovered based on the given dataset.

## **Solution:**
1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
2. Data visualizations
3. Creating and tuning ML models
4. Predicting with ML models

- ### Libraries:
    * Models: AdaBoost and RandomForest
    * Preprocessing: pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn
    * Visualization: matplotlib and seaborn
