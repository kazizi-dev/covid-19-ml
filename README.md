## 📝 **Project Details:**
Taking a data mining approach to understand a COVID-19 dataset, and using machine learning to make predictions.

## ❓ **Problem:**
The number of infected cases continue to rise everyday. Find a way to predict if patients will be hospitalized, deceased or recovered based on the given dataset.

## ✔️ **Solution:**
1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
2. Data visualizations
3. Creating and tuning ML models
4. Predicting with ML models

- ### Libraries:
    * Models: AdaBoost and RandomForest
    * Preprocessing: pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn
    * Visualization: matplotlib and seaborn


- ### 🤝 **Contributions:** 
1. Kourosh: preprocessing, data analysis, data visualizations, building and hyperparameter tuning of models, and documentation
2. Julian: preprocessing, building models, and documentation
3. Robert: preprocessing, documentation
